# Fingerprint-Based-Blood-Group-Detection
This project explores a biometric-based approach to blood group detection using fingerprint patterns. Traditional blood group testing requires chemical reagents and blood samples, but this system aims to provide a non-invasive, cost-effective, and rapid solution by analyzing fingerprint features that correlate with blood group information.
